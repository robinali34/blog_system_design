## Common Mistakes in System Design Interviews

Being aware of common pitfalls is crucial for avoiding them during your interview. Understanding these mistakes can significantly improve your performance and help you stand out as a candidate. Here are some of the most common mistakes candidates make:

### 1. Insufficient Requirement Gathering

Failing to ask detailed questions about the system's requirements can lead to designs that don't meet the user's needs. It's essential to understand:
- The purpose and goals of the system
- Target audience and user base
- Specific functionalities required
- Scale and performance requirements
- Constraints and trade-offs

Always start by clarifying requirements before jumping into design.

### 2. Overlooking Scalability and Performance

Designs that don't account for future growth can become bottlenecks. Always consider:
- How the system will handle increased load
- Data growth over time
- Read vs. write patterns
- Geographic distribution needs
- Caching strategies

Think about scalability from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

### 3. Neglecting Failure Handling

Not planning for system failures can result in significant downtimes. Important considerations include:
- Redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Error handling and recovery
- Data consistency during failures
- Graceful degradation
- Monitoring and alerting

A robust system must handle failures gracefully.

### 4. Inadequate Data Modeling

Poorly designed databases can lead to inefficient queries and data anomalies. Ensure:
- Proper normalization or denormalization based on use cases
- Appropriate indexing strategies
- Data partitioning and sharding when needed
- Query optimization
- Data consistency requirements

Design your data model to support your system's access patterns.

### 5. Ignoring Security Concerns

Overlooking security can expose the system to vulnerabilities. Incorporate:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security best practices from the start

Security should be built into the design, not added later.

### 6. Jumping into Implementation Too Quickly

Many candidates start drawing components before understanding the problem. Always:
- Clarify requirements first
- Think through the high-level architecture
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Get feedback before diving deep

A structured approach leads to better designs.

### 7. Not Communicating Thought Process

Interviewers want to see your thinking. Make sure to:
- Explain your reasoning out loud
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Ask for feedback and clarification
- Show that you're thinking critically

Communication is a key part of the interview.
