## Introduction

Welcome to your preparation guide for Meta's System Design and Product Architecture interview for Specialized Software Engineering (SpecSWE) roles. This interview assesses your ability to design and architect solutions to complex engineering problems, demonstrating your problem-solving skills, technical depth, and communication abilities.

This guide will help you understand what Meta expects, how the interview is structured, and the key strategies for success in these specialized system design interviews.

## Interview Overview

### What is SpecSWE System Design?

The System Design and Product Architecture interview for SpecSWE roles is tailored to assess your ability to solve non-trivial engineering design problems. Unlike coding interviews, this interview focuses on your architectural thinking, problem decomposition, and ability to design solutions that connect multiple concepts.

### Interview Format

- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Format**: No coding involved
- **Tools**: Virtual whiteboard as a visual aid
- **Visual Elements**: Box and arrow diagrams, function signatures, API specifications
- **Style**: Discussion-based, interviewer-driven conversation

### Interview Types

Depending on the job you're applying for and your area of expertise, you may complete one of the following:

1. **System Design Interview**: General system design problems
2. **Product Architecture Interview**: Architecture-focused design problems
3. **In-Domain Design Interview**: Domain-specific design problems

**Important**: Confirm with your recruiter which interviews you need to prepare for.

## In-Domain Design Interview

### Purpose

The In-Domain Design interview is designed to:

- Understand your thought process and approach through solving a technically specific design problem
- Assess your ability to apply domain expertise to design-based projects
- Evaluate how you solve problems in your area of domain expertise

### Key Characteristics

- **Domain-Specific**: Focuses on your area of expertise
- **Design-Focused**: Emphasizes architectural and design thinking
- **Problem-Solving**: Tests your ability to solve problems in unfamiliar spaces using existing domain knowledge

### Important Reminder

**If you come across a topic you're not familiar with, or the question seems vague, don't panic!**

Part of the interview assessment is on whether you can solve problems in an unfamiliar space with your existing domain knowledge. This is actually part of what Meta is evaluating - your ability to adapt and apply your knowledge to new problems.

## What Meta Looks For

### Overall Assessment

The purpose of these interviews is to assess your ability to solve a non-trivial engineering design problem. The interviewer is trying to determine if you can architect a solution to a higher-level problem that requires connecting multiple concepts.

**Key Points:**

- Clarify what "success" looks like
- Understand the business context

### 2. Start High-Level, Then Deep Dive

- Begin with high-level architecture
- Show the big picture first
- Then dive deep into areas you're comfortable with
- Don't get lost in details too early

### 3. Discuss Trade-offs Explicitly

- Always discuss pros and cons
- Make trade-offs clear
- Explain why you're choosing a particular approach
- Consider alternatives

### 4. Think About Failure and Resilience

- Consider failure scenarios
- Discuss how to handle failures

- Explain trade-offs clearly

### 7. Be Collaborative

- Listen to feedback
- Adjust your approach based on input
- Ask for clarification if needed
- Be open to different perspectives

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Jumping to Solutions Too Quickly

**Don't:** Start designing immediately without understanding the problem
**Do:** Ask questions first, understand requirements, then design

### 2. Not Asking Questions

**Don't:** Assume you understand everything about the problem
**Do:** Ask about scale, constraints, requirements, and success criteria

### 3. Staying Too High-Level

**Don't:** Only discuss high-level architecture without diving into details
**Do:** Provide high-level overview, then deep dive into specific areas

### 4. Ignoring Trade-offs

**Don't:** Present one solution without discussing alternatives
**Do:** Discuss multiple approaches and their trade-offs before choosing

### 5. Not Thinking About Failure

**Don't:** Design only for the happy path
**Do:** Consider failure scenarios and how to handle them

### 6. Poor Communication

**Don't:** Mumble through explanations or draw unclear diagrams
**Do:** Explain clearly, use the whiteboard effectively, label everything

### 7. Not Adapting to Feedback

**Don't:** Stick to your initial design even when feedback suggests changes
**Do:** Listen to feedback and adjust your approach

## Quantitative Analysis

### Key Calculations

**Throughput:**
- Requests per second (QPS)
- Operations per second
- Transactions per second

**Latency:**
- Average latency
- P50, P95, P99 latency
- End-to-end latency

**Capacity:**
- Number of users supported
- Data storage requirements
- Bandwidth requirements
- Server/instance requirements

**Memory:**
- Per-request memory
- Total memory usage
- Cache memory requirements

### Example Calculations

- If we have 1 million users, each making 10 requests per day, what's our average QPS?
- If each request processes 1KB of data, what's our memory footprint?
- How many servers do we need for 10,000 QPS if each server handles 1,000 QPS?
- If we store 1GB of data per user, how much storage do we need for 100 million users?

## Conclusion

Meta's SpecSWE System Design and Product Architecture interview assesses your ability to solve complex engineering design problems across four key areas:

- **Problem Navigation**: Your ability to organize problems, ask the right questions, and identify key requirements
- **Solution Design**: Your ability to design working solutions that address the problem
- **Technical Excellence**: Your ability to dive into technical details, identify trade-offs, and mitigate risks
- **Technical Communication**: Your ability to articulate your ideas clearly and respond to feedback

Remember: The interview is designed to assess your problem-solving and design skills, not to test your memory of specific APIs or implementations. Focus on demonstrating your thought process, asking the right questions, and showing how you approach complex design problems.

The questions will be high-level, and it's up to you to drive the conversation. Don't panic if you encounter unfamiliar topics - part of the assessment is whether you can solve problems in unfamiliar spaces using your existing knowledge.

Good luck with your Meta SpecSWE System Design interview preparation!
